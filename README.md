# Binary Tree Programs in Java

This repository contains a variety of programs demonstrating the implementation and manipulation of binary trees in Java. Each program illustrates different operations and algorithms associated with binary trees.

## Programs Included

- **Binary Tree Creation**: Basic implementation of binary tree creation and node insertion.
- **Traversals**:
  - Inorder Traversal
  - Preorder Traversal
  - Postorder Traversal
- **Height of Binary Tree**: Function to calculate the height of the tree.
- **Level Order Traversal**: Implementation of level order traversal (BFS).
- **Searching**: Searching for a specific value in the binary tree.
- **Deletion**: Node deletion operations in a binary tree.
- **Balanced Tree Check**: Checking if the binary tree is balanced.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C-P-AMUTHAN/Binary-Tree-java.git
